# MNIST Data Classification

This Jupyter notebook provides a demonstration of using various machine learning models to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
MNIST is a popular dataset in the machine learning community, containing 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9).  

This notebook is made in reference to my college's Machine Learning Lab mini-project that aims to showcase practical implementation of machine learning algorithms for digit recognition.

## Prerequisites

Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python (>=3.6)
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- TensorFlow
- Keras

You can install Python and Jupyter Notebook using Anaconda or directly from Python.org. 
Once Python and Jupyter Notebook are installed, you can proceed with installing the other dependencies via pip:  
`pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost tensorflow keras`

## Usage

1. Clone this repo or copy download the .ipynb file
2. navigate to the project directory
3. To launch, use `jupyter notebook` command
